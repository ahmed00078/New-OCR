A product carbon footprint is defined as the total\namount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming\npotential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which\nincorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.\nThe information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions\ntable.\nGHG Emissions\nManufacturing Breakout\nDisplay\n60%\nMainboard and other boards\n32%\nChassis\n3%\nOthers*\n3%\nPackaging\n2%\nPower Supply Unit & External Cables\n1%\nEnd of Life\n1%\nUse\n47%\nValue chain\ncarbon footprint\nManufacturing\n52%\nDistribution\n0%\nHP’s environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44.

Provide JSON keys \"carbon_impact\" and \"product_weight\".\n\nLet's analyze the text:\n\nThe text includes lines like:\n- Manufacturing Breakout 1% Mainboard and other boards 32% Solid State Drive( SSD) 29% Display 24% 130 kg CO2 e Chassis 4% Batteries 5% estimated range: Power Supply Unit& External Cables 3% Others 3 2% 110-150 kg CO 2 e Packaging 1%\n\nAlso earlier lines mention \"product weight (kg)\" maybe.\n\nLet's search for product weight. There's a line near the end:\n\n\"To provide the most Product weight( kg) 1.5 accurate data, HP uses...\"\n\nSo product weight is 1.5? But that seems like \"Product weight (kg) 1.5\". That might be 1.5 kg.\n\nAlso earlier: \"product weight( kg)\" maybe other numbers.\n\nLet's parse carefully:\n\nThe text includes repeated lines due to duplication but we need the relevant values.\n\nWe have two key pieces:\n- Carbon impact: likely from manufacturing breakdown, e.g., \"130 kg CO2e\" appears as part of Manufacturing Breakout. That might be carbon footprint for that component? But maybe overall product carbon footprint is 110-150 kg CO2e packaging etc. Let's examine:\n\nThe text includes a line: \"Manufacturing Breakout ... 130 kg CO 2 e Chassis ...\" This seems to indicate the amount of CO2 equivalent per component.\n\nBut we need total carbon impact for the product? The report likely gives overall PCF value maybe around 110-150 kg CO2e. Let's search:\n\n\"estimated range: Power Supply Unit& External Cables 3% Others 3 2% 110-150 kg CO 2 e Packaging 1%\" This indicates packaging contributes 1%. But the \"110-150 kg CO 2 e\" appears as a value.\n\nAlso earlier there is \"130 kg CO 2 e Chassis\". So maybe overall carbon footprint: 110-150 kg? Let's parse:\n\nThe text includes repeated lines but we can extract numeric values. The relevant numbers for carbon impact likely are the ones in kg CO2e units.\n\nWe have at least two distinct numbers:\n1) 130 kg CO2e (Chassis)\n2) 110-150 kg CO2e (Packaging? Actually packaging is separate, maybe this refers to overall product weight? Wait no: \"estimated range: Power Supply Unit& External Cables 3% Others 3 2% 110-150 kg CO 2 e Packaging 1%\" So the packaging portion contributes 1%, but there is a value of 110-150 kg CO2e maybe for packaging.\n\nBut we need carbon impact. The report likely gives overall product footprint: \"product weight(kg) 1.5\" and \"carbon emissions data\".\n\nLet's search again:\n\nThe text includes repeated lines, but the key numbers are:\n- Manufacturing Breakout ... 130 kg CO 2 e Chassis\n- Packaging 110-150 kg CO 2 e\n\nAlso earlier there is: \"product weight(kg) 1.5\" maybe.\n\nBut we need to provide carbon impact and product weight.\n\nCarbon impact likely refers to the overall carbon footprint of the product, which might be given as a range or single value. The text includes \"110-150 kg CO2 e\". That seems like an estimate for packaging? But could also represent total emissions: 110-150 kg CO2e.\n\nLet's examine context:\n\n\"Manufacturing Breakout ... Packaging 1%\"\n\nBut the line with \"110-150 kg CO 2 e\" appears after \"Others 3 2%\" maybe part of manufacturing breakdown. It might be a value for packaging? Actually it's ambiguous.\n\nHowever, we can provide carbon impact as 110-150 (kg CO2e). But need numeric; could use average or range: maybe 120? We may choose the middle of range: 140? Wait no: The text says \"110-150 kg CO 2 e\". That is a range. So we might set value to null because ambiguous.\n\nBut perhaps there is also earlier line with \"130 kg CO 2 e Chassis\" which indicates chassis component's emissions, not total.\n\nWe need overall carbon impact for product; maybe the report includes that as part of PCF: The text says \"product weight(kg) 1.5 accurate data\". That might be weight but no emission value.\n\nLet's search again:\n\nThe first lines mention:\n- \"Manufacturing Breakout ... 130 kg CO 2 e Chassis\"\n- Then packaging line with \"110-150 kg CO 2 e\"\n\nThus maybe the overall product carbon footprint is between 110 and 150 kg CO2",

Calculated energy consumption is then used in combination with average emissions factors \nfor the designated country of use to calculate emissions. \nEnd of Life: It is assumed that a designated portion of the product (see table above) is recycled at the end of the use period determined \nin the TEC methodology.  It is also assumed that the balance of the product waste materials is disposed of by landfill.  Emissions \ngenerated during the mechanical destruction, separation and transport of end of life materials are included in the calculation. \nProducts scope of this sheet includes desktop computer, integrated desktop computer, notebook computer, monitor and tablet. \nThis document is only valid in connection with “THE ECO DECLARATION” of the specific product.",

We have two requested fields: carbon_impact and product_weight.\n\nThe document contains \"Product carbon footprint report| 08- Jan- 2024 OMEN by HP ...\". The relevant data:\n\n\"Manufacturing Breakout 1% Mainboard and other boards 33% Solid State Drive( SSD) 21% Display 24% 230 kg Co2 e Chassis 7% Batteries 6% 190-280 kg Co2 e Power Supply Unit& External Cables 2% Others 3% 5% Packaging 1% 50% 9% Assumptions Lifetime of product( years) 4 Product carbon footprint results are highly dependent on the tools, Use location North America carbon emissions data...\"\n\nWe need to extract \"Carbon impact (in kg CO2 eq or equivalent)\" and \"Product weight\".\n\nWhere is product weight? The text says: \"Product weight(kg) 3 as well as high- quality lifecycle assessment data.\" So product_weight = 3. But maybe units are kg.\n\nAlso carbon_impact likely from the line \"230 kg Co2 e\" etc. Let's parse:\n\nWe have multiple values for CO2 emissions per component? The text: \"Display 24% 230 kg Co 2 e Chassis 7%\" This seems to be a breakdown of percentages and weight maybe?\n\nLet's examine more carefully.\n\nThe snippet includes many numbers but we need the overall carbon impact in kg CO2 eq. There is likely an aggregated value somewhere else. Let's search for \"kg\" near top: The text says:\n\n- \"Manufacturing Breakout 1% Mainboard and other boards 33%\" etc.\n- Then \"Solid State Drive( SSD) 21%\"\n- \"Display 24%\"\n- \"230 kg Co 2 e Chassis 7%\"\n- \"Batteries 6% 190-280 kg Co 2 e\"\n- \"Power Supply Unit& External Cables 2% Others 3%\" etc.\n\nIt seems to be a breakdown of contributions. The overall carbon impact might not explicitly given but we can approximate from the percentages? But maybe there is an explicit value: \"230 kg\" appears multiple times. Let's parse:\n\nThe line \"Display 24% 230 kg Co 2 e Chassis 7%\" indicates that display accounts for 24% of total, with weight 230 kg CO2e?? Actually might be a mis-structured text.\n\nAlso there is \"190-280 kg Co 2 e\" after Batteries. So maybe the product's carbon footprint includes these values: For each component we have percentages and associated mass in kg? Hard to parse.\n\nBut likely they want the overall carbon impact value from this report, which might be given as a single number somewhere else. Let's search for \"kg CO2\". The text shows:\n\n- 230 kg Co 2 e\n- 190-280 kg Co 2 e\n\nAlso earlier: \"Product weight( kg) 3\"\n\nThus product_weight = 3 (maybe in kg). Carbon impact maybe the sum of all contributions? But we can approximate by adding percentages times weights. Let's compute:\n\nWe have components with percentages and associated mass values.\n\nList:\n- Mainboard and other boards: 33% (no weight)\n- Solid State Drive(SSD): 21%\n- Display: 24%\n- Chassis: 7% but also \"230 kg Co2 e\" maybe for chassis? Actually the line shows \"Display 24% 230 kg Co 2 e Chassis 7%\" So display has 24%, weight 230kg, CO2e ??? Not clear.\n\nLet's parse as:\n\nComponent | % contribution | Weight (maybe) | Emission value\n- Mainboard and other boards: 33%\n- Solid State Drive(SSD): 21%\n- Display: 24% with \"230 kg Co 2 e\" maybe for display? Actually the line shows \"Display 24% 230 kg Co 2 e Chassis 7%\" So after display, there is weight 230kg and then chassis.\n\nBut we can treat that as separate components:\n\nChassis: 7%\n- Batteries: 6% with \"190-280 kg Co 2 e\"\n- Power Supply Unit & External Cables: 2%\n\nAlso others etc. But no explicit total emission value given.\n\nMaybe the carbon impact is not directly provided but derived from percentages and weights? The question likely expects to extract numeric values present in text for both fields:\n\nCarbon Impact: maybe \"230 kg\" or \"190-280 kg\". Which one?\n\nThe document includes two ranges: 230 kg, 190-280 kg. Might be the carbon impact of product is between these.\n\nBut we need a single value; could use first occurrence? The question likely expects to extract numeric values present in text for each field:\n\nCarbon Impact (in kg CO2 eq or equivalent) -> maybe \"230\" from line: \"Display 24%",

Let's search for \"kg\" etc.\n\nText snippet includes lines like: \"Manufacturing Breakout 0% Mainboard ... Solid State Drive( SSD) 21% Display 24% 180 kg Co2 e Chassis 5% 20% Batteries 3% 180-220 kg Co 2 e Power Supply Unit& External Cables 2% Others 32% Packaging <1% Distribution 73%\" etc.\n\nAlso \"Product weight(kg) 2.3 as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data.\"\n\nSo product_weight = 2.3 (likely in kilograms). Carbon impact: we need to find kg CO2 eq or equivalent. The text includes many numbers but not clear. There's a line with \"180 kg Co 2 e\" maybe refers to emissions? Let's parse.\n\nThe snippet:\n\n```\nManufacturing Breakout 0% Mainboard and other boards 42% Solid State Drive( SSD) 21% Display 24% 180 kg Co 2 e Chassis 5% 20% Batteries 3% 180-220 kg Co 2 e Power Supply Unit& External Cables 2% Others 32% Packaging <1% Distribution 73%\n```\n\nThis seems to be a breakdown of emissions percentages and amounts. The \"180 kg CO2e\" appears twice: once after Display, maybe for display? Actually the line shows:\n\n- Solid State Drive( SSD) 21%\n- Display 24%\n- 180 kg Co 2 e Chassis\n- 5% 20% Batteries 3%\n\nBut it's unclear.\n\nAlso \"Product weight (kg) 2.3\".\n\nWe need to extract carbon impact in kg CO2 eq or equivalent. The text may contain a value for emissions: maybe the total emission is given somewhere else? Let's search again:\n\nThe earlier part says: \"HP's PCF s cover full value chain emissions, which include ...\"\n\nBut no numeric.\n\nMaybe there are numbers like 180-220 kg Co 2 e etc. That might be product weight or carbon impact?\n\nLet's parse carefully the entire text snippet provided in prompt (the long block). Let's copy relevant part:\n\n```\nProduct carbon footprint report| 08- Jan- 2024 HP 15 Laptop ENERGY STAR As part of HP' s commitment to continually improve product sustainability, one tool HP utilizes is product carbon footprinting ( PCf). This helps HP to understand carbon impacts and implement reduction opportunities throughout a product's life cycle.  HP' s PCF s cover full value chain emissions, which include carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, component and product manufacturing, distribution, product use, and end- of- service.

So product_weight = 2.3.\n\nNow carbon impact: We need to find a number in kg CO2 eq or equivalent. The text includes numbers like \"180 kg Co 2 e\" and \"180-220 kg Co 2 e\".\n\nWhich one is the total? Might be two separate categories: maybe chassis emission 180 kg, power supply unit 180-220 kg.\n\nBut we need a single number for carbon impact. Could use the first numeric value that appears after manufacturing breakdown percentages. The line shows:\n\n\"Manufacturing Breakout 0% Mainboard and other boards 42% Solid State Drive( SSD) 21% Display 24% 180 kg Co 2 e Chassis 5% 20% Batteries 3% 180-220 kg Co",

Calculated energy consumption is then used in combination with average emissions factors \nfor the designated country of use to calculate emissions. \nEnd of Life: It is assumed that a designated portion of the product (see table above) is recycled at the end of the use period determined \nin the TEC methodology.  It is also assumed that the balance of the product waste materials is disposed of by landfill.  Emissions \ngenerated during the mechanical destruction, separation and transport of end of life materials are included in the calculation. \nProducts scope of this sheet includes desktop computer, integrated desktop computer, notebook computer, monitor and tablet. \nThis document is only valid in connection with “THE ECO DECLARATION” of the specific product.",
