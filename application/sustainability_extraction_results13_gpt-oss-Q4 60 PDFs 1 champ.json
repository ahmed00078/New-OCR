We must find numeric value in the doc.\n\nThe document contains many repeated lines of numbers like 260, etc. Let's search for values that look like emissions.\n\nWe see a section:\n\n\"Manufacturing Breakout\nMainboard and other boards\n41%\nSolid State Drive (SSD)\n32%\nDisplay\n16%\nChassis\n5%\nBatteries\n3%\nPower Supply Unit & External Cables\n2%\nOthers3\n2%\nPackaging\"\n\nBut not numeric values. Then later we see lines:\n\n\"kg CO2e 260 kg CO2e ... etc.\" Many repeated.\n\nWe need to find a value for carbon impact in the document: maybe \"Carbon footprint is X kg CO2e\".\n\nSearch earlier part: The text includes \"Product weight (kg) 1.7\". Not relevant.\n\nLook at top lines:\n\n\"Product carbon footprint results are highly dependent on the tools, ...\"\n\nBut no numeric.\n\nScrolling near bottom of repeated block: we see many numbers like \"260\", maybe representing emissions in kg CO2e? Let's examine pattern: The text shows a series of 260 values with some formatting. It might be part of graph or chart representation but not clear.\n\nWe need to extract the carbon impact value from this document. Possibly there is a numeric figure for \"Carbon footprint\" like \"X kg CO2e\".\n\nSearch again:\n\nThe repeated block lines: \n```\n230\n260\nkg CO2e\n...\n```\n\nIt appears multiple times. The first instance shows 230, then 260 etc.\n\nLet's parse the snippet near top of that section:\n\nWe see:\n```\n230\n260\nkg CO2e\nkg CO2e\n200\n260\nkg CO2e\n5%\n200\n260\nkg...\n```\n\nIt seems like a chart with two values: maybe \"230\" and \"260\". The first value 230 might be the carbon impact? But we need to confirm.\n\nLet's search for \"Carbon Impact\" phrase. Not present.\n\nMaybe there is an image of graph but not captured in text; only numbers appear as separate lines.\n\nThe repeated block shows many times:\n\n```\n200\n260\nkg CO2e\n5%\n...\n```\n\nIt might be a chart with two bars: 200 and 260? The first value maybe \"230\" earlier. Let's examine the top of that section again:\n\nScrolling near start of repeated block:\n\nWe see:\n```\n230\n260\nkg CO2e\nkg CO2e\n200\n260\n...\n```\n\nIt might be a chart with two bars: one at 230, another at 260? Actually there are many lines.\n\nLet's parse the entire snippet from \"230\" to end of repeated block:\n\nThe text shows:\n```\n230\n260\nkg CO2e\nkg CO2e\n200\n260\n...\n```\n\nBut we need to find a single numeric value for carbon impact. The doc might have multiple values: maybe 260 kg CO2e is the main figure.\n\nLet's search again earlier part:\n\nThe text includes \"Carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, component and product manufacturing...\"\n\nNo numeric there.\n\nMaybe the repeated block shows two bars representing \"Manufacturing Breakout\" percentages? But not relevant.\n\nWait we saw a section: \n```\nMainboard and other boards\n41%\nSolid State Drive (SSD)\n32%\nDisplay\n16%\nChassis\n5%\nBatteries\n3%\nPower Supply Unit & External Cables\n2%\nOthers3\n2%\nPackaging\n< 1%\nAssumptions\nLifetime of product (years) ...\n```\n\nThis is a breakdown percentages. Not numeric.\n\nBut the repeated block with numbers \"260\" might be part of chart for carbon emissions: maybe each bar shows value in kg CO2e, e.g., one at 200 and another at 260? The first line after that section may show two bars representing something like \"Carbon impact\".\n\nLet's search again near top lines:\n\nThe doc includes:\n```\nProduct weight (kg)\n1.7\nScreen size (in)\n14\nMemory\n16GB\nStorage\n512GB\n...\n```\n\nNo.\n\nOk maybe the carbon impact is 260 kg CO2e? Because repeated block shows \"200\" and \"260\". The first value might be 230, second 260; but we need to decide which one corresponds to carbon impact. Let's examine earlier part: It says:\n\n```\nkg CO2e\n5%\n...\n```\n\nThe numbers appear as percentages maybe.\n\nBut the user wants \"Carbon impact (in kg CO2 eq or equivalent)\". So likely there is a numeric value for emissions in kg CO2eq, perhaps 260? Because repeated block shows many times of \"200\" and \"260\".\n\nLet's search again: The doc includes lines:\n\n```\n230\n260\nkg CO2e",

The question: \"Extract the following information from this document text:\n\n- Carbon impact (in kg CO2 eq or equivalent)\n\nReturn a JSON with these exact keys: carbon_impact\"\n\nSo we must find numeric value for carbon impact in kg CO2e.\n\nThe provided text includes some numbers but not clearly labeled as 'carbon impact'. Let's parse. The snippet shows \"Manufacturing Breakout 1% Mainboard and other boards 30% Solid State Drive( SSD) 30% Display 25% 130 kg CO 2 e Chassis 4% Batteries 6% estimated range: Power Supply Unit& External Cables 3% Others 3 2% 110-150 kg CO 2 e Packaging < 1% Production 77%\" etc. Hard to parse.\n\nWe need a single numeric value for carbon impact in kg CO2e. The text includes \"130 kg CO 2 e\" maybe the total? Also later: \"estimated range: Power Supply Unit& External Cables 3% Others 3 2% 110-150 kg CO 2 e Packaging < 1%\" So there is a value of 110-150 kg CO2e. But we need one number.\n\nMaybe they want to extract the carbon impact from this sustainability report, likely the total emission: \"130 kg CO2e\" appears near 'Display' maybe? Let's examine:\n\nThe snippet shows: \"... Display 25% 130 kg CO 2 e Chassis 4%\" So after display there is a value of 130 kg. That might be carbon impact for that component.\n\nBut we need overall carbon impact; likely the total emission across product lifecycle. The text includes \"Manufacturing Breakout\" and percentages but not sum.\n\nMaybe they want to extract 'Carbon impact (in kg CO2 eq or equivalent)' from this document: maybe there is a single value somewhere else? Let's search for numeric values:\n\n- 130 kg\n- 110-150 kg\n\nAlso earlier: \"Production 77%\" etc. Not helpful.\n\nThe question likely expects we parse the text and produce carbon_impact as null if not found or ambiguous. But they might expect to extract '130' from that snippet.\n\nLet's analyze more carefully:\n\nText excerpt:\n\"Manufacturing Breakout 1% Mainboard and other boards 30% Solid State Drive( SSD) 30% Display 25% 130 kg CO 2 e Chassis 4% Batteries 6% estimated range: Power Supply Unit& External Cables 3% Others 3 2% 110-150 kg CO 2 e Packaging < 1% Production 77%\" etc.\n\nIt seems like a table of percentages and associated emissions. The \"130 kg CO 2 e\" appears after Display, maybe the emission for display component? But then there is also '110-150 kg' which might be packaging or something else.\n\nThe question: \"Extract the following information from this document text:\n\n- Carbon impact (in kg CO2 eq or equivalent)\"\n\nThus we need to provide a numeric value. The best candidate appears as 130 kg CO2e, but maybe they want the overall carbon footprint of product? Could also be '110-150' range.\n\nBut which one is more likely? Let's examine context: \"Manufacturing Breakout\" then percentages for each component; after that we have values like:\n\n1% Mainboard and other boards\n30% Solid State Drive( SSD) 30%\nDisplay 25% 130 kg CO2 e Chassis 4%\n\nSo maybe the table lists components with their share of emissions. The '130 kg' might be emission for display component.\n\nBut then we have \"estimated range: Power Supply Unit& External Cables 3% Others 3 2%\" etc, and later \"110-150 kg CO 2 e Packaging < 1%\" So packaging has a range 110-150? Actually it's '110-150 kg CO 2 e' maybe for packaging.\n\nThus the overall carbon impact might be sum of all components: but not given. The only explicit numeric values are:\n\n130\n110-150\n\nAlso earlier \"Production 77%\". Not relevant.\n\nSo we need to decide which value to output as carbon_impact. I'd choose '130', because it's a single number, no range; easier for JSON.\n\nBut maybe they want the overall emission: packaging has 110-150 kg CO2e but that's also numeric with hyphen. But ambiguous.\n\nLet's check if there is any other explicit numeric values:\n\nScrolling earlier part of text: \"Manufacturing Breakout 1% Mainboard and other boards 30%\" etc. Not relevant.\n\nThus we will output carbon_impact as 130 (kg). Provide integer or float? Use number; no units needed because key expects value in kg CO2 eq.\n\nReturn JSON with key 'carbon_impact': 130\n\nBut maybe they want null if not found: but there is a numeric value",

Calculated energy consumption is then used in combination with average emissions factors \nfor the designated country of use to calculate emissions. \nEnd of Life: It is assumed that a designated portion of the product (see table above) is recycled at the end of the use period determined \nin the TEC methodology.  It is also assumed that the balance of the product waste materials is disposed of by landfill.  Emissions \ngenerated during the mechanical destruction, separation and transport of end of life materials are included in the calculation. \nProducts scope of this sheet includes desktop computer, integrated desktop computer, notebook computer, monitor and tablet. \nThis document is only valid in connection with “THE ECO DECLARATION” of the specific product.",

Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as\nglobal warming potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040 & ISO 14044.\n2.The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of the most common configuration for this notebook. Specifications used in this assessment are listed in the\nassumptions table. HP reports the estimated mean PCF value along with confidence intervals.\n3.Others includes assembly energy, other subassemblies, and all subassemblies packaging and transport.\n© Copyright 2021 HP Development Company, L.P.
